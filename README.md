Treehouse Techdegree Project 7: Twitter API

Ronald van der Bergh

This project uses the Twitter API (REST) to access a user's Twitter account and display the five most recent tweets, followers, and private messages. The information is rendered using Pug templates with Express on Node.js.

For extra credit, the application allows the user to send a tweet. If something goes wrong with routing, the user receives user friendly feedback. The user's personal Twitter background is displayed as a header.

For this project, Treehouse provided CSS and HTML files.
